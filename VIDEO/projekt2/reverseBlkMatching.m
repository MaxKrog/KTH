function [ reconstructedPatch ] = reverseBlkMatching( motionVector, blockDifference, referenceImage )
%% 
% This function reconstructs a patch of a video frame using the input arguments by
% performing the inverse operations of those in blockMatching.m . 

% If necessary, you can add block index corresponding to the image patch and motion
% vector to the input arguments.

% Input: see blockMatching.m 
% Output: the reconstructed patch.
